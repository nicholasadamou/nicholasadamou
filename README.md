I am a performance-driven full-stack software engineer with a strong background in both front-end and back-end development for cloud-native applications. My expertise spans a broad array of web-based technologies, and I pride myself on my software design, system architecture, requirements analysis, and problem-solving skills. 

Beyond my technical skills, I firmly believe in the power of community and collaboration. I regularly contribute to Stack Overflow, providing solutions and answers to programming challenges that have reached hundreds of thousands of developers worldwide. At IBM, I have contributed to inner-source initiatives, constructing reusable assets and working collaboratively with cross-function teams to deliver quality code.

Mentorship is a passion of mine. I have served as a software engineering mentor for interns and EPH, coaching them in technical skills, professional development, and best practices in software development. I find great satisfaction in guiding the next generation of software engineers and playing a role in preparing them for successful careers in the field.

## Find me on the command-line

Assuming you have the latest npm installed, you can use via `npx`:

```
npx nicholasadamou
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command; that'd be creepy. ü§®
