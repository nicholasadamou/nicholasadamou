## About Me

I am currently a 👀🐝Ⓜ️ Software Engineer and a recent graduate from Cornell College. My mission is to learn as much as I can about different areas of the computer. I absolutely love programming. The mere ability to write a few lines of code and have something unique and interesting come up on the screen fascinates me each and every day!

Because of my interest in computers, I've had the unique opportunity to intern and work for a few software engineering companies such as Blackbird, Mack Media Group, and IBM where I met and networked with many great and vastly talented engineers.

At all three of those companies, I leveraged cutting-edge JavaScript technologies such as React, React Native, Graph QL, Apollo, React-Redux, Amazon AWS and more to construct applications driven to excel each company's bottom-line.

## Find me on the command-line, via `npx`

Assuming you have the latest npm installed, you can use via `npx`:

```
npx nicholasadamou
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command; that'd be creepy. 🤨
