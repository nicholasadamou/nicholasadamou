<h1>Hi üëãüèº, nice to meet ya! I'm Nick!</h1>

I'm Nicholas Adamou, a passionate Senior Software Engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Cornell College. My journey in software engineering has led me to work with some of the biggest names in the industry, including IBM.

At [DotBrains](https://github.com/dotbrains), I am the Founder, and I have developed various tools to enhance productivity and streamline development environments. Notably, I created the [`set-me-up`](https://github.com/dotbrains/set-me-up-docs) toolkit, which automates macOS development environment setup with customizable dotfiles and shell scripts. Additionally, I built [`ghw`](https://github.com/dotbrains/ghw), a command-line tool that enhances the GitHub CLI for better repository management.

During my tenure at IBM, I have significantly contributed to projects involving cloud-native applications, scalable solutions, and CI/CD pipelines. My expertise spans various technologies, including Java Spring Boot, React.js, Python, Tekton, and Shell Scripting. I have a proven track record of improving developer workflows, and developing full stack applications and microservices.

I am also recognized for my mentoring and coaching abilities, having received multiple awards for my contributions to the IBM Developer Profession. My work has been acknowledged with accolades such as the Growth Award and the Beacon of Excellence Mentoring Award.

My technical skills include Java, JavaScript (React, Angular, Next, Node.js, TypeScript), Python, Go, Ruby on Rails, and a variety of DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Tekton, Helm, and more. I am proficient in managing databases such as Db2, Cloudant, and MongoDB.

Outside of my professional work, I have participated in numerous hackathons and technical presentations, consistently delivering innovative solutions and winning recognition for my efforts.

## Find me on the command-line

Assuming you have the latest npm installed, you can use via `npx`:

```
npx nicholasadamou
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command; that'd be creepy. ü§®
