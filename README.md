# It's me, Nick! 👋🏼 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasadamou/nicholasadamou.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasadamou/nicholasadamou)

## Usage

### npm

Assuming you have the latest npm installed, you can use via `npx`:

```
npx nicholasadamou
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command; that'd be creepy. 🤨
