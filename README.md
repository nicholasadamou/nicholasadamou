I am a full-stack software engineer and graduate student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) focused on building accessible, human-centered financial products at [IBM](https://ibm.com).

## Find me on the command-line

Assuming you have the latest npm installed, you can use via `npx`:

```
npx nicholasadamou
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command; that'd be creepy. 🤨
