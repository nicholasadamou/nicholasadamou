# Hi 👋🏼, nice to meet ya!

Currently, I am an IBM senior software engineer. I primarily focus on the front-end and back-end of cloud-native applications. Recently I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Cornell College where I earned my degree in Computer Science. I have always been a highly organized and goal-driven individual who is a problem solver by nature. I love programming because I can use my skills as a software engineer to improve the lives of others by developing fun and intuitive applications.

## Find me on the command-line [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasadamou/nicholasadamou.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasadamou/nicholasadamou)

Assuming you have the latest npm installed, you can use via `npx`:

```
npx nicholasadamou
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command; that'd be creepy. 🤨
