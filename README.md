It's me, Nick! 👋🏼 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasadamou/nicholasadamou.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasadamou/nicholasadamou)

# Usage

## npm
```
npx nicholasadamou
```

## GitHub Package Registry
Assuming you have the GitHub registry set up, you can use via npx:
```
npx @nicholasadamou/card
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy. 🤨
